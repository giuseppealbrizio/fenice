## [Unreleased]

### Added

- AI Builder pipeline: prompt-to-PR code generation via Claude API with tool use

- Context reader: builds LLM context bundle from project codebase (CLAUDE.md, schemas, models, services, routes)
- Code generator: multi-turn Claude API loop with write_file, modify_file, read_file tools
- Self-repair: validation failure triggers one repair attempt via Claude before failing
- Project validator: runs typecheck, lint, and test via child_process with 60s timeout
- File writer with scope policy enforcement and recursive directory creation
- Git operations: branch creation, commit with conventional format, push, cleanup via simple-git
- GitHub PR creation via Octokit with structured body (summary, file lists, risk checklist)
- Builder world notifier: emits `builder.progress` delta events and synthetic service/endpoint deltas via WebSocket
- `builder.progress` event type added to WorldDeltaEvent discriminated union (9th event type)
- Builder tools added to MCP manifest (builder_generate, builder_get_job, builder_list_jobs)

- Pino logger redaction for sensitive keys (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GITHUB_TOKEN, JWT secrets)
- Builder kill switch: `BUILDER_ENABLED=false` returns 503
- JWT + admin RBAC + dedicated rate limit (5 req/hour) on builder endpoints
- New dependencies: `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `simple-git`, `@octokit/rest`
- 75+ new unit and integration tests for builder subsystem (536 total tests, 61 files)

- World model Zod schemas (WorldService, WorldEndpoint, WorldEdge, WorldModel) with schema version 1
- ProjectionService for OpenAPI 3.x to WorldModel transformation (tag grouping, pairwise edges, auth detection)
- World WS protocol schemas (subscribe, snapshot, delta, ping/pong, error) with discriminated unions
- WorldWsManager with monotonic seq numbering, ring buffer (configurable size), Base64 resume tokens with TTL
- World WS message handlers for subscribe flow (full snapshot and resume with catch-up) and ping/pong keepalive
- World Gateway WebSocket endpoint at `GET /api/v1/world-ws` with JWT query-param authentication
- Environment variables: `WORLD_WS_BUFFER_SIZE` (default 1000), `WORLD_WS_RESUME_TTL_MS` (default 5min)
- Integration tests for ProjectionService (live OpenAPI parsing) and World WS (subscribe, snapshot, resume flows)
- Unit tests for world schemas, projection service, world WS manager, and world handlers (97 new tests)
- React + R3F client scaffold (`client/`) with Vite 6, React 19, Three.js 0.173, Zustand 5
- Client-side WorldModel types mirroring backend Zod schemas (plain TypeScript interfaces)
- WebSocket connection hook with auto-reconnect (3s), ping/pong (25s), and resume token support
- Zustand stores for world state and building selection
- Deterministic grid layout service (services → districts, endpoints → buildings)
- 3D city renderer: buildings colored by HTTP method, hover glow, click selection
- District ground planes with service tag labels and edge connectors
- HUD overlay with connection status indicator and HTTP method color legend
- Side panel with endpoint details (path, method, summary, auth, params, related endpoints)
- Client CI job (lint, typecheck, test, build) in GitHub Actions
- Client unit tests for layout service, Zustand store, and color mappings (24 new tests)
- WS protocol contract tests validating producer/consumer message schemas (31 tests)
- Demo dry run e2e tests verifying M1 acceptance criteria: 100% endpoint mapping, zero crashes, performance under 1.2s, correct metadata, building non-overlap (23 tests)
- 3D world docs index (`docs/3d-world/README.md`) and M2 realtime overlay execution plan

### Fixed

- World WS manager now ignores stale close/error callbacks and closes replaced sockets safely
- World WS resume validation now rejects future timestamps in resume tokens
- Client WS hook hardened against malformed messages and stale socket lifecycle race conditions
- Setup/bootstrap docs updated for 3D client token flow (`client/.env.example`, Quickstart, root README)
